Welcome to the Trilinos Developer Website!

The Trilinos Project Homepage can be found at [trilinos.org](https://trilinos.org).

We are in the process of moving the old Developer site to GitHub, while updating content in the process. A specific plan will appear here when it is available.

## Links to related Trilinos Developer Sites

    * Plan for adoption of the [TriBITS Lifecycle model](http://trac.trilinos.org/wiki/TribitsDevelopmentPractices) and everything that goes with that
